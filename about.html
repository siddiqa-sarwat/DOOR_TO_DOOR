    Door to door management is the process of organizing last-mile delivery operations. 
            Door to door  management involves scheduling order deliveries and assigning them to couriers, overseeing operations, planning and optimizing routes, overseeing vehicles, managing fuel, and handling courier expenses approvals.
            here are three main objectives of courier management:

Deliver products to customers.
Support the couriers delivering those products.
Ensure that customers have a great buying experience, so they come back for more.
It sounds simple, but each goal comes with its own set of challenges. Deliveries are time-sensitive, and products can be fragile. Couriers will face obstacles in the field, including traffic, difficulty locating addresses, and customers who aren’t home. And your customers expect frequent updates.

It’s a lot to juggle, whether you’re a seasoned professional or just starting a courier business. The best way to reach these objectives is to break each one down into simpler tasks. We’ve done this for you below.
